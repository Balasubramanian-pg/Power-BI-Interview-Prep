## **Question 1: Why This DAX Code Fails**  

### **Scenario**  
You are given a measure that attempts to count rows from a `Sales` table where the total sales (a measure) exceed 500, using the following incorrect syntax:  

```dax
Measure = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Sales), [Total Sales] > 500)
```

### **Error**  
This results in a semantic error:  
```  
"A function placeholder has been used in a true/false expression that is used as a table filter expression. This is not allowed."  
```

### **Root Cause**  
In DAX, you cannot directly use a measure like `[Total Sales] > 500` inside the filter argument of `CALCULATE()`. The filter argument must evaluate to a **table**, not a scalar boolean.  

### **Correct Implementation**  
Use the `FILTER()` function to iterate over a table and apply a row-level logical condition.  

```dax
CorrectMeasure = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(Sales),
    FILTER(
        Sales,
        [Total Sales] > 500
    )
)
```

### **Explanation**  
- `FILTER(Sales, [Total Sales] > 500)` returns a filtered table where only rows with total sales > 500 remain.  
- `CALCULATE` changes the evaluation context and counts rows on that filtered table.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Always use `FILTER()` when applying row-level conditions in `CALCULATE()`.  

### **Practical Insight**  
This question tests understanding of **context transition** and how measures behave inside row context. A common rookie mistake is treating measures as direct filters—which they are not. This is a classic debugging scenario in real-world BI development.  

## **Question 2: DAX Optimization Using `SELECTEDVALUE()`**  

### **Initial DAX Pattern**  
```dax
Measure = 
IF(
    HASONEVALUE(Sales[Country]),
    VALUES(Sales[Country])
)
```

### **Purpose**  
To return the selected country name from a slicer.  

### **Problem**  
While functional, this approach is inefficient, as it uses:  
- `HASONEVALUE()` to ensure a single selection.  
- `VALUES()` to retrieve that value.  

This is verbose and can impact performance on large models.  

### **Optimized Approach Using `SELECTEDVALUE()`**  
```dax
OptimizedMeasure = SELECTEDVALUE(Sales[Country])
```

### **Benefits**  
- **Cleaner syntax.**  
- **Internally optimized** by the engine.  
- **Eliminates redundant conditional checks.**  
- **Reduces DAX query plan time**, as observed in Performance Analyzer.  

> [!TIP]  
> `SELECTEDVALUE()` is a performance-aware syntactic sugar for a common `IF + VALUES` construct.  

### **Practical Insight**  
This tests awareness of modern, idiomatic DAX. Optimizing for simplicity without sacrificing accuracy is critical in production-grade dashboards.
