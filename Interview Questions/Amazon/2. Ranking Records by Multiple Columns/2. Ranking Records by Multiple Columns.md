# **Ranking Records by Multiple Columns**  

## **Scenario Explained**  

The video discusses a **Power BI interview question** where you need to **rank records based on multiple columns** (State and Population).  

### **Problem**  
- A table has **3 columns**: `Customer`, `State`, and `Population`.  
- There are **duplicate states** (e.g., Assam appears twice, Chennai three times, Delhi twice).  
- **Goal**: Create a **measure** that ranks records **within each state** based on **population** (highest to lowest).  

> [!NOTE]  
> This problem tests your ability to handle ranking within groups and use DAX functions like `RANKX` and `FILTER`.  

### **Example Data**  

| Customer | State  | Population |  
|----------|---------|------------|  
| Cust1    | Assam   | 1500       |  
| Cust2    | Assam   | 2500       |  
| Cust3    | Chennai | 700        |  
| Cust4    | Chennai | 4500       |  
| Cust5    | Chennai | 5000       |  
| Cust6    | Delhi   | 3000       |  
| Cust7    | Delhi   | 2000       |  

### **Expected Output**  
- For **Assam**:  
  - 2500 → Rank **1**  
  - 1500 → Rank **2**  
- For **Chennai**:  
  - 5000 → Rank **1**  
  - 4500 → Rank **2**  
  - 700 → Rank **3**  
- For **Delhi**:  
  - 3000 → Rank **1**  
  - 2000 → Rank **2**  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The ranking must be done **within each state**, not globally.  

## **Solution: Using `RANKX` with Filtering**  

Since `RANKX` alone ranks across the entire table, we need to **filter by state first** before ranking.  

### **DAX Measure**  
```dax  
Rank =  
VAR MaxState = MAX('Table'[State])  // Gets the current state in the row context  
VAR FinalRank =  
    RANKX(  
        FILTER(                  // Filters the table to only the current state  
            ALL('Table'),         // Ignores external filters  
            'Table'[State] = MaxState  
        ),  
        SUM('Table'[Population]), // Ranks by population within the filtered state  
        ,                        // (Skip ties parameter)  
        DESC,                    // Higher population = higher rank  
        DENSE                    // No gaps in ranking (optional)  
    )  
RETURN FinalRank  
```  

### **How It Works**  

1. **`MAX('Table'[State])`**  
   - Captures the **current state** in the row context (e.g., "Assam" for the first two rows).  

2. **`FILTER(ALL('Table'), 'Table'[State] = MaxState)`**  
   - Creates a **subset of the table** containing **only rows for the current state**.  
   - `ALL('Table')` ensures we ignore any external filters.  

3. **`RANKX(..., SUM('Table'[Population]), DESC, DENSE)`**  
   - Ranks the **filtered table** by population in **descending order**.  
   - `DENSE` ensures no gaps in ranking (e.g., 1, 2, 2 → 1, 2, 3).  

> [!TIP]  
> Use `FILTER` with `ALL` to isolate records for the current state and ensure accurate ranking.  

### **Key Takeaways**  

1. **`RANKX` alone ranks globally**—you need **filtering** to rank within groups.  
2. **`FILTER + ALL`** is used to isolate records for the current state.  
3. **`MAX([State])`** captures the state dynamically for each row.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a **common Power BI interview question** testing your ability to:  
> - Use **row context** in measures.  
> - Combine `RANKX` with filtering.  
> - Handle **multi-column ranking logic**.  

### **Alternative Approach (Simpler)**  

If your data model has a **relationship between tables**, you could also use:  
```dax  
Rank =  
RANKX(  
    FILTER(ALLSELECTED('Table'), 'Table'[State] = SELECTEDVALUE('Table'[State])),  
    SUM('Table'[Population]),  
    ,  
    DESC  
)  
```  

> [!NOTE]  
> This approach leverages relationships and `SELECTEDVALUE` for simpler filtering.
